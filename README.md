# HomeTree

Welcome to `hometree` a library for building and traversing **ho**momorphic **me**rkle **tree**s for fast cryptographic 
signing and integrity checks over large filesystems and data stores. Hometree maintains a transaction
ledger monitoring and tracking changes to signed artefacts using homomorphic hashing (incremental hashing) and Merkle 
Trees. 

The transaction ledger provides time stamped:

- update attestation
- diffs
